            THOSE WHO ARE AT ONE REGARDING FOOD ARE AT ONE IN LIFE. ~Malawian Proverb
        </p>
        <P>From Morocco to South Africa, Senegal to Ethiopia, Jamaica to Barbados, there's 
            an array of sweet, savory, and spicy flavors that are ingredients in Africa's 
            rich and textured history. With shows like Africa on a Plate and Minjiba Entertains, 
            I am here to showcases some of the best and most well-known culinary dishes 
            Africa and the African Diaspora have to offer.
        </P>
        <P>
            Whether you,re a seasoned chef or a first-timer, these accessible
            recipes will open the gateway to Africa. 
            Experience the breadth of African food in your own kitchen by making these
            authentic dishes from across the continent. ;)
